# MCS Analyser
This is the front end of the Analyser app for the MCS server.

## Education
This project is being made by Vincent Vermeire. A student at Fontys ICT & Software Engineering. During semester 3 I had to make a fullstack web app, build a CI/CD pipeline and assure my projects quality by performing integration tests and research. For more information, please take a look at my [portfolio](https://github.com/crazyvinvin/Portfolio-S3).

## What is the analyser for?
The Analyser makes it possible to analyse data produced by systems on the MCS Minecraft server. The MCS Systems make use of little robots called turtles. These turtles are part of a mod called MCS-CC (Just another Computercraft fork).

## Where can I see the analyser in action?
